# Automated Text Illustration

This repository contains a comprehensive set of scripts designed for the automated generation of text illustrations, with a particular focus on Hebrew language processing. The pipeline integrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, translation services, and advanced models to enhance and visualize textual content seamlessly.

## Scripts

### 1. `streamlit_app.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** December 28, 2023

This script serves as the main application for the project. It utilizes multiple functionalities to enhance and visualize textual content in Hebrew, including translation, summarization, text segmentation, and text-to-image generation. The script is built using the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web application. Key features include:
- **Translation:** Converts Hebrew text to English for processing.
- **Coreference resolution :** Focusing on replacing specified pronouns with the corresponding character names or references. It leverages spaCy's advanced coreference Usint external Docker Space of HF.
- **Summarization:** Summarizes paragraphs to extract the most relevant content.
- **Text Segmentation:** Breaks down text into paragraphs using NLP techniques.
- **Image Generation:** Generates illustrations based on text using models from Hugging Face's API.

### 2. `generate_and_enhanced_best_sentences.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** December 5, 2023

This script intelligently evaluates and enhances textual content by leveraging spaCy, Transformers, and a BERT-based model. It performs the following functions:
- **Sentence Evaluation:** Scores and selects the best sentences from paragraphs based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.
- **Sentence Enhancement:** Integrates descriptive words into the best sentences using a text generation model, improving the richness of the content.

### 3. `paragraphs_summary.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** November 23, 2023

This script uses the Falconsai summarization pipeline and tokenizer to summarize a collection of paragraphs. Each paragraph is individually summarized, ensuring that the most important information is retained. It is particularly useful for condensing large texts while preserving essential content.

### 4. `text_segmentation.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** November 19, 2023

Utilizing spaCy and Sentence Transformers, this script segments text into logical paragraphs. It employs natural language processing to:
- **Identify Sentence Boundaries:** Detects where one sentence ends, and another begins.
- **Determine Paragraph Breaks:** Uses pre-trained models to analyze sentence embeddings and determine the best points to divide text into paragraphs.

### 5. `google_translator.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** November 19, 2023

This script employs the GoogleTranslator from the deep_translator library to automatically translate Hebrew text into English. It is essential for preparing Hebrew content for further processing, such as summarization and image generation, which require English input.

### 6. `text_to_image.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** December 12, 2023

This script handles the generation of illustrations from textual descriptions. Key features include:
- **Streamlit Integration:** Creates a user-friendly web application for inputting text and generating images.
- **Hugging Face API Integration:** Connects to Hugging Face models to generate images based on processed text.
- **Character Descriptions:** Incorporates character descriptions directly into the image generation prompts, ensuring that the generated images are closely aligned with the narrative.

### 7. `coreference_resolution.py`

**Author:** Ran Moshe  
**Date:** August 23, 2024

This script is designed to perform coreference resolution on a given text, focusing on replacing specified pronouns with the corresponding character names or references. It leverages spaCy's advanced coreference model, along with a pronoun density calculation, to determine when coreference resolution is necessary. The script includes functions for:
- **Core Name Extraction:** Extracting core names from mentions with priority given to main characters.
- **Pronoun Density Calculation:** Calculating the density of pronouns relative to named entities.
- **Coreference Resolution:** Mapping specified pronouns to their corresponding core names within the text.
- **Text Reconstruction:** Reconstructing the text with resolved coreferences while removing redundant phrases.
